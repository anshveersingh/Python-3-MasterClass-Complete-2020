    "# 00 - Why Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi! I am @anshveersingh and welcome to the complete python course! This course is for everyone and is free. So, this is a bootcamp for Python 3. But first, ask yourself, why do you want to code? All are doing? Or just increasing your knowledge? Or just want to start a career in computer science programming? Ah, once you know that, you are ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Coding? \n",
    "\n",
    "Coding is just telling a computer what to do! Ah, you may be saying this is an easy work, but no, this consists of a whole new universe! There are three types of programming languages - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Low - Level Programming languages: They are programming languages but are machine readable, like --> 0x001\\n0x002\\n0x003 or 01001001001000100100100010100100010101001010100.  \n",
    "2. Middle - Level - Programming languages: They are middle levelled, as the word pronounces. Like - C: See the following code: printf(\"Hello World!\"); You can read this, and it also can be used for machines.\n",
    "3. High - Level - Programming languages: They are human - readable, means they are just like giving the computer response in English. But, an interepter (which converts this into machine code AKA binary) converts it into machine code and the computer understands what to do. See the following: "
